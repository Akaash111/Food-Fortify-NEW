1. Agents/Entities in the system: food producers(farmers), distributors, retailers, gov. Agencies, food banks, Non-profit organisations that collect food/community centers/other initiatives

2. We have a database containing the details of the respective agents 

3. Logistics management to track the quantity of food distributed to each entity across SG (UI: something like an interactive map)

4. Real time monitoring system that tracks food inventory levels across these entities, distribution process (from location A to B) and also the consumption levels

5. Prediction and forecasting system that used past datasets to anticipate shortages and surpluses and sends warnings respectively (using ML, events like political issues, natural disasters or stuff like food export bans and so on)

6. Traceability of food: system for tracking products from producers to retailers which helps recalls of spoilt food easier in the case of food poisoning

7. Alerts on the availability of unused stock (surpluses) that is about to expire so that other entities on the platform who might be interested (hawkers: can buy fresh produce that is about to expire soon and turn in into meals within the next day easily) 

8. The running simulation of all these interlinked processes as an example for our presentation
